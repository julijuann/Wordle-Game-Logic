## Wordle-Game-Logic
This Python game allows players to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts, emulating the popular game Wordle. Players receive feedback on letter accuracy and position, enabling them to refine their guesses effectively. The project demonstrates efficient handling of user inputs through string manipulation and list operations.
